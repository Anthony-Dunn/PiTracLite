**The PiTrac Assembly Guide - Version 2**

Overview:  
This document explains the process of building a typical PiTrac DIY Launch Monitor (LM) using the Version 2 Enclosure and the new PiTrac Compute Board.  This process includes the assembly of all of the physical components, including the 3D-printed parts and hardware, such as cameras and Raspberry Pi computers.  Detailed printing instructions for the 3D parts are contained in the directories that have the respective part files.  Instructions for certain stand-alone sub-assemblies such as the camera mounts are contained in separate documents, but linked to from this main document.  Instructions for the software components of the LM are separate and available [here](https://github.com/jamespilgrim/PiTrac/blob/main/Documentation/Raspberry%20Pi%20Setup%20and%20Configuration.md).

New Material for Enclosure 2:
Tower Construction
Screw the M2x6 self-tapping screws into the back plate just far enough so that a little of the tip of the screw goes beyond the other side.
WARNING - These little screws are delicate (especially if carbon steel), so don't over-tighten
The screws will act to help register the back plate and front plate halves of the parts of the tower.
Use thick, slower-drying super-glue such as Starbond Gap Filler Thick High Performance Super Glue to glue the halves together
The tower halves do not always have material in the same places, so take care not to add glue to portions of one half that will not be adjacent to the other half.
NOTE - make sure that the bottoms of the halves (especially for the base parts) are well-registered so that the completed, glued tower will sit and attach flat to the base box.
<PICTURES>
Use clamps judiciously to make sure the parts are glued securely
Tight the screws through the two sides as you work your way up the tower
